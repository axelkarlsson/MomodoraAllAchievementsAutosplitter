# MomodoraAllAchievementsAutosplitter

This autosplitter for Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight also tracks the status of all achievements for the game for the All Achievements category.

It is also doing a lot more than an autosplitter ever should, which is why this should not be used/done and instead the livesplit component that tracks the achievements should be used instead. https://github.com/axelkarlsson/MomodoraAllAchievementsAutosplitter
